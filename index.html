                    I am excited by the opportunity to join Bending Spoons as an intern, and I coded up this website to 
                    show why I believe that I would be very successful as a software engineer. What attracted me to Bending Spoons 
                    is the unique niche you’ve carved out in the market. While I’m focused on building a career in tech, I’ve always
                    been interested in finance, and the way in which you blend the innovative culture of a tech company with the 
                    acquisitions and strategies of a private equity firm is fascinating. The fast-paced environment, where you’re 
                    trusted to work autonomously on multiple projects, 
                    is also really appealing - it seems like the perfect way to learn quickly and deeply, 
                    which is what motivates me most at this stage in my career.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that I am a strong candidate as I combine an aptitude for software engineering with
                    other skills that are vital for success at this firm, such as communication skills and 
                    business sense. I realise that it is not enough to just be able to code: I bring an 
                    understanding of how software and finance meet, and how quantitive techniques lie at the heart of 
                    both disciplines.
