                I study Applied and Computational Mathematics at University College Dublin. In first year I entered into 
                a general Science programme and have progressively specialised from there - First to Mathematics and
                Physics, then to Mathematics and finally to Applied and Computational Mathematics. Along the way I've taken 
                many interesting electives, such as in Computer Science, Philosophy and Economics. The most important skills 
                I have learned are in quantitative techniques and computer programming, giving me a strong base to 
                formulate problems rigorously and solve them using technology.

            I’m currently on a year abroad at the University of Edinburgh
             This opportunity has allowed me to deepen my understanding of advanced mathematical techniques 
             while experiencing a new academic environment.
            
            In Edinburgh, I’m focusing on topics like using programming to compute numerical solutions to 
            mathematical problems, while also gaining an understanding of the underlying dynamics. 
             I’ve also been involved in extracurriculars such as the Edinburgh University Trading
             and Investment Club, where I work on developing quantitative trading strategies, and the Formula Student 
             team, contributing to business model development for autonomous vehicles.
            
            Outside of academics, I’ve enjoyed exploring the city and taking advantage of new opportunities, 
            from hiking in the Highlands to participating in university events.
