        I’ve been tutoring students preparing for their Leaving 
        Certificate in mathematics, helping them grasp key concepts
         and improve their problem-solving skills. By offering personalized support,
          I assist them in tackling challenging topics, getting ready for exams, and 
          building confidence in their abilities. This experience has taught me how to 
          explain complex ideas clearly and adapt my teaching methods to fit each student’s unique learning style.

            As a tennis coach at Deerpark and Shankill Tennis Clubs, I have worked with players across various age groups 
            and skill levels, focusing on technical development and strategic play. My coaching experience extends to 
            volunteering with the Irish Visually Impaired Tennis team, where I contributed to their preparation for the 
            World Championships in Italy. It was incredibly rewarding to see the team achieve two bronze medals. 
            Coaching has not only allowed me to share my passion for the sport but has also strengthened my leadership, 
            communication, and mentoring skills.
